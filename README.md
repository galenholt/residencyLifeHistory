# residencyLifeHistory
Contains code to make the figures illustrating the relationships between amphidromy, larval survival, and proportion of resident adults from Lisi et al. *Stream and ocean hydrodynamics mediate partial migration strategies for an amphidromous Hawaiian goby*.

The code should be fairly robust to changes in R and package versions. It is likely overkill, but for strict reproducibility, versions are given in renv.lock file for all packages and dependencies. Opening the project and running `renv::restore()` should set up exactly the package environment used here if running the script alone fails. 

Code is current as of manuscript acceptance.
